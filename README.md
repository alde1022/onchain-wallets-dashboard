# Open Crypto Tax Helper

## What this is

Open Crypto Tax Helper is a self-hosted wallet/transaction records organizer for crypto tax review. It helps find missing cost basis, organize transactions, and expose structured data to AI agents or tax professionals.

It is informational software only. It is not tax, legal, accounting, investment, or compliance advice.

Status: standalone open-source utility, separate from CheapTokens and other payments products.

**Free, self-hosted, AI-agent-friendly crypto records organizer.**

Connect your wallets, fix the missing-cost-basis problem, and produce a clean, structured dataset for your own review, your AI agent, or a qualified tax professional.

> **Important:** This is informational software only. It is not tax, legal, accounting, investment, financial, or compliance advice; it does not determine filing obligations; and exports are draft worksheets, not official tax forms. Verify everything with a qualified professional before filing or making decisions.

> Originally built to find missing cost basis in my own taxes. Saved me a lot of money when I handed it to Claude to review. Open-sourcing it so you can do the same.

- 🪙 **Aggregate** wallets across Ethereum, Bitcoin, Solana, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, Avalanche, BSC.
- 🔎 **Find** every disposal where cost basis is unknown — the headline workflow.
- 🕵️ **Discover forgotten wallets** by analyzing counterparties across your existing transactions. Bidirectional flow + multi-chain presence + repeated interaction = a wallet you probably own and forgot. Adding one usually unlocks a stack of missing-basis problems at once.
- 🤖 **Agent-native**: an MCP server + REST API + JSON export. Claude proposes fixes; you approve in-app.
- 🧾 **Review-ready**: draft Form 8949/Schedule D-style worksheets, income summaries, plus a structured JSON export your accountant or LLM can parse.
- 🔒 **Self-hosted**: read-only wallet tracking. Your keys never leave your wallet. MIT-licensed.

## Quick start (local, no Firebase)

The fastest path is local-auth mode (single user, no Google Cloud setup).

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd onchain-wallets-dashboard
cp .env.example .env       # then edit DATABASE_URL etc.
docker compose up          # starts Postgres + the app at http://localhost:5000
```

Then visit http://localhost:5000. You're already "logged in" as the local user. Add a wallet on the **Wallets** page, sync it, and watch your transactions appear.

### Using your AI agent

1. Go to **Settings → Agent API Tokens** and create one (e.g. `claude-desktop`, scopes `read` + `basis:propose`).
2. Build the MCP server: `cd mcp && npm install && npm run build`.
3. Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "open-crypto-tax": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/onchain-wallets-dashboard/mcp/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "OPEN_CRYPTO_TAX_URL": "http://localhost:5000",
           "OPEN_CRYPTO_TAX_TOKEN": "octt_..."
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. In Claude, ask: *"What transactions are missing cost basis? Look up historical prices and propose fixes."* Claude reads your data via the MCP tools and submits proposals. Approve them on the **Agent Proposals** page.

## Manual install (no Docker)

You need: Node 20+, PostgreSQL 14+.

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# edit DATABASE_URL to point at your Postgres

npm run db:push     # apply schema
npm run dev         # http://localhost:5000
```

---

## Configuration

Everything is environment-variable driven. See `.env.example` for the full list. Key ones:

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | yes | Postgres connection string |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | yes (prod) | Session cookie secret |
| `AUTH_MODE` | no | `local` (default if no Firebase) or `firebase` |
| `LOCAL_USER_ID` | no | User id when `AUTH_MODE=local` (default `local-user`) |
| `ALCHEMY_API_KEY` | no | Required to sync EVM wallet transactions |
| `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` | iff `AUTH_MODE=firebase` | Multi-user auth |
| `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | iff `AUTH_MODE=firebase` | Service account JSON |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | no | Push notifications + classify-by-reply |

## How "agent fixes it all" works

```
┌─────────┐   propose      ┌──────────┐   approve     ┌──────────┐
│ Agent   │ ─────────────► │ Proposal │ ─────────────►│ Applied  │
│ (MCP)   │                │  queue   │ ◄─────────── │ + audit  │
└─────────┘                └──────────┘   reject      └──────────┘
```

- The agent **never** mutates state directly. It calls `POST /api/agent/propose`.
- A `proposals` row is created with `actor`, `action`, `payload`, `reasoning`, `confidence`, and `evidence_url`.
- You approve or reject on the **Agent Proposals** page (or auto-approve fires if the token is configured for it and confidence ≥ threshold).
- Approval applies the change and writes a row to the append-only `audit_log`.
- Every cost basis your agent fills in carries `basis_source`, `basis_evidence_url`, `basis_set_by` — so you and your accountant can trace where the number came from.

## API

Self-describing OpenAPI 3.1 spec at `/api/openapi.json`. The agent-relevant endpoints:

- `GET  /api/agent/work` — prioritized work queue
- `POST /api/agent/propose` — submit a proposal (idempotent via `idempotency_key`, supports `dry_run`)
- `GET  /api/proposals` — list proposals
- `POST /api/proposals/:id/approve` — apply
- `POST /api/proposals/:id/reject` — reject
- `GET  /api/audit` — append-only audit log
- `GET  /api/transactions/missing-basis` — every disposal lacking basis
- `GET  /api/export/json` — full structured dump

Agents authenticate with `Authorization: Bearer octt_...` tokens issued in Settings.

## Status

Working today: wallet aggregation (Alchemy + **Etherscan V2 fallback**), transaction sync, classification + custom rules, **FIFO/LIFO/HIFO/specific-ID** cost-basis matching, Form 8949/Schedule D CSV exports, **agent proposal workflow + audit log**, **MCP server**, **JSON export**, **OpenAPI spec**, **local-auth mode**, **generic CSV importer** (Coinbase/Kraken/Binance/Robinhood-shaped), **forgotten-wallet discovery + transfer-pair candidate detection**, **Vitest** tests for the math-critical pieces.

Planned (PRs welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)):
- Wash-sale detection
- Native Solana / Bitcoin sync
- Per-exchange importer presets (auto-detect Coinbase header, etc.)
- More tests around the proposal applier and the agent token middleware

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). TL;DR: report vulnerabilities privately. Don't commit `.env`. API tokens are stored as SHA-256 hashes; the plain value is shown exactly once.
